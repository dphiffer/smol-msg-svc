			<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

			<h2>Quick Version</h2>

			<p>Small Data Cooperative and <i>smol msg svc</i> are safe spaces that every participant can express themselves in without fear of judgement or harassment. Please respect members' gender pronouns and their right to engage or disengage in conversation. Anyone engaging in disrespectful or harassing activities will be banned.</p>

			<h2>The LONGER VERSION (to which ALL members are beholden to)</h2>

			<p>Small Data Cooperative and <i>smol msg svc</i> are safe spaces where you can express yourself without fear of judgment or harassment. All members are expected to treat others with respect. Under the umbrella of respect, we expect all members be mindful of their speech and behaviors both in person (during in-real-life meetups) and on social media. Particularly, we want to remind members to refrain from making assumptions about another's identity, experience, and preferred pronouns.</p>

			<p>No form of harassment or assault will be tolerated, this includes but is not limited to physical harassment, verbal harassment, and any form of sexual assault. Those who violate this policy will be banned and/or reported to the authorities.</p>

			<p>If you feel unsafe or uncomfortable, please chat with a moderator (send "/mod" via smol) or email <a href="mailto:hello@smalldata.coop">Dan or Caroline</a>. If you see someone being treated with disrespect, please speak up either yourself or by getting a moderator involved. With your help we can make sure everyone involved is being treated with respect.</p>

			<p>The following will be considered harassment: physical or verbal threats; unwelcome attention; stalking; pushing, shoving, or use of physical force; behavior that creates a disturbance or is dangerous, including lewd or generally offensive behavior or language; using sexually explicit or offensive language or conduct; excessive profanity; obscene gestures; use of racial, religious, sexual, gender, ability, or ethnic slurs.</p>

			<p>We will absolutely not tolerant hate speech, harassing language, and bullying in any shape or form. Anyone engaging in such behavior will be asked to leave. Small Data supports thought provoking and fun creativity in technology in safe and inclusive spaces. Safety and diversity are equally important as fun.</p>

			<p>If a person tells you “no,” your business with them is done. If you continue to attempt to have contact with that person, you may be banned or asked to leave the in-real-life meetup.</p>

			<h3>Remember:</h3>

			<p>“No” means no.</p>

			<p>“Stop” means stop.</p>

			<p>“Go away” means go away.</p>

			<p>Attire is not consent.</p>
